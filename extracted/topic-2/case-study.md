# Topic 2 Case Study — Fabrikam, Inc.

Background -

Fabrikam, Inc., is a global consumer goods company that is undergoing a digital transformation initiative to migrate its entire infrastructure to the Microsoft cloud. As a key element of this cloud migration, the company will implement Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales, moving away from the current on-premises proprietary technologies used by its business-to-business (B2B) sales team.

As part of the cloud migration, Fabrikam will adopt an AI-first approach to its business solutions and implement AI solutions, wherever possible, to streamline operations.

Problem Statements -

Fabrikam's infrastructure currently relies on various on-premises systems that require sales executives to use corporate computers with physical keyboards to access business information during customer interactions. Mobile phones cannot be used for these purposes, as the systems depend on keyboard input. As a result, the sales executives spend a lot of time using keyboards to search for data on several disparate systems and file servers, rather than focusing on the customers. This affects the customer experience.

Fabrikam stakeholders are concerned that users will be hesitant to adopt AI. If the AI initiatives are NOT adopted, cost savings will never be realized. Additionally, funding for future AI initiatives will depend on demonstrating an increase in AI adoption month over month. As the AI agent initiative for the sales team will be the first for Fabrikam, the rapid adoption of the agent is a high priority.

Planned Initiatives -

General -

Fabrikam management has prioritized AI-driven projects to improve efficiency, customer engagement, and responsible AI adoption. The current application infrastructure is on-premises and must be migrated to the cloud to support the adoption of these technologies.

Infrastructure Migration -

Fabrikam plans to migrate from its current on-premises infrastructure to a completely cloud-based topology; this will include user authentication, the security framework, and, primarily, the adoption of the services by end users.

All the data from the different systems will be consolidated into a single data source - a common data model that will use a Microsoft Dataverse environment as a single source of truth (SSOT) for the sales team.

Sales Cycle Enablement -

To achieve the company's objectives, Fabrikam intends to implement the following strategies to enhance the sales cycle:

Use low-code development to create a single AI agent that has Dataverse as its core component.

Ensure that sales managers can access unanswered correspondence from prospects and intervene as appropriate.

Replace the previous proprietary software with Dynamics 365 Sales to track sales cycles and customer interactions.

Have the sales executives use Dynamics 365 Sales to track interactions for open opportunities and send follow-up communications to prospects.

Have the sales executives use handsfree headsets to interact with an AI agent when they have questions about internal policies or customer data.

Requirements -

Infrastructure Migration -

Fabrikam has identified the following infrastructure migration requirements:

Azure must be used for all future infrastructure workloads.

The company must follow Microsoft-recommended methodologies for infrastructure migration to the cloud.

Any created AI agents must have their return on investment (ROI) calculated to ensure that the solution will save the company money.

Sales Cycle Enablement -

Fabrikam has identified the following requirements for sales cycle enablement:

The final AI agent must follow Microsoft recommendations for a conversational user experience.

A designated checklist must be reviewed to ensure that the AI agent follows Microsoft deployment recommendations for a compliant solution.

Detailed telemetry must be logged for the first created AI agent to help troubleshoot and optimize the agent during the initial AI agent adoption process.

Unexpected AI agent actions must end in an escalation to a live representative. For example, a sales executive must be rerouted to a representative if the agent cannot answer a question after two failed attempts.

The return on investment (ROI) of switching from the current process to the future process is required for stakeholder sign off.

The sales team must use Dynamics 365 Sales to correspond with prospects more quickly and efficiently than currently.

Sales managers must report on the adoption of the AI agent to key Fabrikam stakeholders on a monthly basis.

Any sensitive information, such as user IDs and names, shared via the AI agent must be tracked for future auditing.

# Topic 2 Case Study — Contoso, Ltd. (Questions 28-29)

Overview -

Contoso, Ltd. is a high-tech manufacturing company that uses Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, and Dynamics 365 Commerce for its North American operations. The company designs and develops innovative products that have many patents and proprietary technologies. The patents and engineering designs are closely guarded secrets.

Contoso executives want to integrate and adopt AI solutions to help scale the company in preparation for an anticipated period of rapid growth. The company has multiple legal entities and Azure subscriptions that will be used in the adopted AI solutions.

Requirements -

AI Adoption -

The following executives will have specific responsibilities in the overall AI adoption:

- Chief Technology Officer (CTO): Select one Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management or Dynamics 365 Commerce prebuilt AI agent and one custom Microsoft Copilot Studio AI agent to prioritize and deploy during the initial AI adoption phase.
- Chief Information Officer (CIO): Ensure that appropriate security labels are assigned to the data used by the AI agents.
- Chief Financial Officer (CFO): Analyze the return on investment (ROI) for the AI agents being deployed.
- Chief Information Security Officer (CISO): Discover and inventory AI resources for auditing.
- Chief Executive Officer (CEO): Ensure that all solutions adhere to industry-standard responsible AI practices.

All AI initiatives and agents will have a detailed business use case, a defined audience profile, and an estimated ROI that will compare the cost savings of the current process against the estimated costs of using the new AI solutions.

The company's research and development (R&D) department already has a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that contains comprehensive product specifications and compliance data.

Prebuilt AI Agent -

The CTO has NOT yet selected which prebuilt AI agent to use in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. The CTO wants to view available agent templates to identify which agent will add the most business value.

Depending on which high-priority AI agents are identified, its agent capabilities must be previewed in a discovery meeting with the relevant business operation stakeholders.

Custom AI Agent -

Contoso has identified the following custom AI agent requirements:

- The custom AI agent will use data from Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management to answer questions for the manufacturing team as a low-code solution.
- The custom AI agent will be accessible from within Microsoft Teams.
- The custom AI agent must be designed to eventually connect to other agents that can be selected based on their description.
- The topics used in the custom AI agent will be selected based NOT on a trigger phrase, but on a description of the purpose of the query, to make the interactions more conversational.
- The custom AI agent must be able to answer questions about product specifications by using existing technologies. The product specifications are maintained by the R&D department.
- The custom AI agent must be integrated with and accessible from Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.
- The custom AI agent must be able to use Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management business logic that is stored outside of the application.

Analysis, Reporting, and Troubleshooting

Contoso has identified the following analysis, reporting, and troubleshooting requirements:

- The CISO will audit all the AI solutions monthly for compliance and security.
- The CFO will analyze all the AI solutions quarterly to compare the estimated ROI against actual measured efficiencies and adoption. The CFO will use the Copilot Studio agent usage estimator to perform this analysis.
- The CISO wants to identify how much sensitive data was accessed for a given AI agent run and who accessed the data. Too much sensitive data accessed by a single user might indicate a high security risk.
- The CTO wants to track user feedback on the quality of the AI agent responses during user interactions with the agents. Consistently poor feedback will trigger an escalated reengineering discussion.
- The CEO wants a quarterly assessment of all the required metrics for their specific responsibilities. The tools used for the assessments must be Microsoft-recommended and must verify reliability, interpretability, fairness, and compliance.
- The CFO wants to identify how many interactions with the AI agents are abandoned on a given day as compared to resolved conversations. Too many abandoned sessions might indicate that Copilot Studio credits are being used inefficiently by end users.
